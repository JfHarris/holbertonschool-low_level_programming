**Strong**__Beginning with C__

After a few weeks using bash scripts at Holberton, we jumped into programming in C. It was a great learning experience. C can be intimiadting, especially for people who are new to programming. I enjoyed it though. The control C gives you is empowering and, at times, frustrating.

This repository includes a wide range of projects we completed at Holberton.
Including:
1. Our introduction to C. [link](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world "Hello, World")
2. Pointers! [link](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings "Pointers")
3. This was one of my favorite assignments at Holberton. [link](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x14-bit_manipulation "Bit manipulation")
